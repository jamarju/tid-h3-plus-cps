# Harakiri - Graceful Context Death

Before the context window fills up, persist all valuable knowledge gained in this session.

## Instructions

1. **Read** the current `CLAUDE.md` file

2. **Update** the handoff document with:
   - Increment the session number
   - Update the "Last Updated" date
   - Update the "Status" with current state
   - Add any new discoveries, gotchas, or learnings from this session
   - Update "Remaining Work" if tasks were completed or new ones identified
   - Add any new files created to the "Key Files" list

3. **Commit** the changes with a descriptive message of what was done during the session.

4. **Report** a brief summary of what was persisted

## Important

- Be concise - the handoff should help the next agent get up to speed quickly
- Don't duplicate info already in other docs (memory-map.md, settings-reference.md, etc.). Reference these files instead.
- Focus on gotchas, workflow tips, and current project state
